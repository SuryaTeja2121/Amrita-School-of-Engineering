# Computational Engineering Mechanics
## This course mainly deals wiht the fundamentals of Robotics ( Kinematics and Kinetics ).
### The project deals with the basic understanding of Planar Mechanisms , which is the most rudimentary concept for anyone to understand the framework of Robotics.
### It consists of Postion Analysis , Velocity Analysis and Static Force Analysis of a complex mechanism known as ‘Koppelkurven – Rastgetriebe’.
#### For more info on the mechanism , please refer to this URL : (https://www.dmg-lib.org/dmglib/main/portal.jsp?mainNaviState=browsen.manim.viewer&id=504022).
